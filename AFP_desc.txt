Formal Development of a Polychronous Polytimed Coordination Language
by Hai Nguyen Van, Frédéric Boulanger and Burkhart Wolff

The design of complex systems involves different formalisms for modeling their different parts or aspects. The global model of a system may therefore consist of a coordination of concurrent sub-models that use different paradigms.

We develop here a theory for a language used to specify the timed coordination of such heterogeneous subsystems by addressing the following issues:
- the behavior of the sub-systems is observed only at a series of discrete instants,
- events may occur in different sub-systems at unrelated times, leading to polychronous systems, which do not necessarily have a common base clock,
- coordination between subsystems involves causality, so the occurrence of an event may enforce the occurrence of other events, possibly after a certain duration has elapsed or an event has occurred a given number of times,
- the domain of time (discrete, rational, continuous...) may be different in the subsystems, leading to polytimed systems,
- the time frames of different sub-systems may be related (for instance, time in a GPS satellite and in a GPS receiver on Earth are related although they are not the same).

Firstly, a denotational semantics of the language is defined. Then, in order to be able to incrementally check the behavior of systems, an operational semantics is given, with proofs of progress, soundness and completeness with regard to the denotational semantics. These proofs are made according to a setup that can scale up when new operators are added to the language.
In order for specifications to be composed in a clean way, the language should be invariant by stuttering (ie adding observation instants at which nothing happens). The proof of this invariance is also given.
